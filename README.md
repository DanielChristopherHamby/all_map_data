# Southern Literature Map Data
This repository stores all of the map data created for Eng 355 Southern Literature. The data was created through collaborative work across four novels:
- Their Eyes Were Watching God
- The Color Purple
- Salvage the Bones
- Shell Shaker

The data is organized by sub-directory in the `refined_data` folder.
